                <br>The aim of this project is to explore the impact of overworking in Japan, focusing on "Karoshi," which translates to "death from overworking." Karoshi encompasses fatal cases and mental illnesses caused by excessive working hours.<br>

                <br>The first reported case of Karoshi occurred in 1960 with the death of a 29-year-old male worker. Over the years, labour force surveys have highlighted alarming trends, showing that many male workers were regularly working over 60 hours per week, 50% above the standard 40-hour workweek, leading to increased risks of death and severe health impacts.<br>

                <br>In response, Japanese authorities introduced the Karoshi Hotline National Network to support affected workers and raise awareness of the issue. This project aims to analyse historical trends, identify high-risks and ultimately shed light on how overworking continues to shape Japanese society and workplace culture.<br>

                This scatter plot illustrates a positive correlation between total suicides and work-related suicides in Japan from 1978 to 2022. The trend line indicates that as the number of total suicides rises, work-related suicides also increase, emphasising the significant impact of overwork as a contributing factor to suicide rates.

                This graph displays work-related suicides in Japan (2014–2023). After a steady decline from 2014 to 2020, cases rose sharply in 2021, peaking in 2022, could be due to overworking and quarantine taking its mental toll on workers.

                Labor participation rates show Japan’s steady growth, indicating a rising percentage of workers. This reflects an overwork culture, linked to burnout and health issues. Germany shows similar trends and faces comparable overwork challenges.

            <p class="small2"> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                <br>While working on this project, collecting all the required data was quite challenging. For instance, when comparing labor participation rates, I needed to retrieve API data for 10 countries and use loops to gather information simultaneously. Figuring out the first loop was the hardest part, but once I got it working, I was able to reuse the code since the data shared the same table format.<br>

                <br>Scraping data for Karoshi calls was particularly difficult because the data was a mix of annual and biannual records. To address this, I used a loop to separate the data by year, extracted the year values, and summed up the entries for the same years.<br>

                <br>Finding data on Karoshi was exhausting, as much of it predates the internet and is scarce. However, previous studies on this topic were invaluable in helping me compile data and create credible charts.<br>

            <h11>Conclusion</h11>
            <p class="small2">
                The analysis of overworking in Japan highlights the ongoing challenges posed by excessive working hours and their severe health and societal impacts. Visualisations of trends in working hours, health outcomes, and labour participation rates have provided valuable insights into the factors contributing to "Karoshi". Overworking in Japan is still a massive pheonomeon and still may need further studies and the Japanese government to intervene for Yearly Karoshi rates to reduce.

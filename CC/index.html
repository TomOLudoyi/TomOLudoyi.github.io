                In this project, I am aiming to explore the impact of overworking in Japan. ‘Karoshi’ translated to ‘death from overworking’, relates to any mental illnesses developed and fatal cases due to over working.
                The first case of Karoshi was reported in 1960 due to the death of a 29-year-old male worker. As time went on, Labour force surveys shows that the that males were working over 60 hours per week (50% above the standardised 40 hour working week) which could lead to more death due to work. Japanese authorities decided to set up a hotline to help support the affected workers. This was called the Karoshi Hotline National Network.

                This scatter plot illustrates a positive correlation between total suicides and work-related suicides in Japan from 1978 to 2022. The trend line indicates that as the number of total suicides rises, work-related suicides also increase, emphasising the significant impact of overwork as a contributing factor to suicide rates.

                Labor participation rates show Japan’s steady growth, indicating a rising percentage of workers. This reflects an overwork culture, linked to burnout and health issues. Germany shows similar trends and faces comparable overwork challenges.

                In this project, I am aiming to explore the impact of overworking in Japan. ‘Karoshi’ translated to ‘death from overworking’, relates to any mental illnesses developed and fatal cases due to over working.
                The first case of Karoshi was reported in 1960 due to the death of a 29-year-old male worker. As time went on, Labour force surveys shows that the that males were working over 60 hours per week (50% above the standardised 40 hour working week) which could lead to more death due to work. Japanese authorities decided to set up a hotline to help support the affected workers. This was called the <a href="https://karoshi.jp/english/">'Karoshi Hotline National Network'</a>

            Data was then recorded from 1988 – 2007. To retrieve this data I had to scrape the website using BeautifulSoup. Challenges I faced during my scraping session was that data was mixed between annually and biannually and there was a column which I did not need (Tokyo)
